### Project Scope

The Long Island Library Resource Council (LILRC) distributes a survey to all libraries collecting data on salaries for all workers. Public libraries submit a spreadsheet containing salary data on all workers, while private libraries individually report their income. The purpose of this project is to develop a system to collect and aggregate data into a standardized format for review and analysis.

### Objectives

**1. Create a Python script to take in raw survey data and convert it into a standardized format.
2. Create a pipeline for merging and analyzing data between multiple years.
3. Explore Tableau and Looker Studio as options for data visualization and analysis.**

4. Incorporate geospatial data to visualize trends based on location.
5. Find state/national level salary data to compare with our region-level data.
   

### Notes/Guidelines

1. Public libraries must be able to submit a spreadsheet, individual reporting can be flexible in format (currently using an airtable survey).
2. Survey fields should be open-ended, can be further condensed and constrained in Python aggregation.
3. Nassau libraries submit their own spreadsheet, which may vary significantly from the survey sent by the LILRC.
